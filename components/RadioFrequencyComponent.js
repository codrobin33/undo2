                        As our bodies age, they may start to show more fat deposits despite regular diet and exercise. Our skin might sag
                        and show more cellulite. At Undo Skincare Center in Kansas City, Missouri, we can use radiofrequency (RF) body contouring
                        to reduce these signs of aging.

                        This treatment can:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduce loose skin to enhance your appearance</li>
                        <li>Tighten, sculpt, and tone the skin</li>
                        <li>Boost circulation, metabolism, and lymphatic drainage</li>
                        <li>Smooth body contours</li>
                        <li>Increase collagen production</li>

                        <li>Shrink fatty area</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It also can treat acne scars, fine lines and wrinkles, cystic acne, stretch marks, and uneven skin tone. Body
                        contouring may be able to transform your body into what you have dreamed of.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Is RF Body Contouring?</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a non-invasive technique that uses heat and RF energy to shape your body by getting rid of undesirable fat
                        cells. The technology also smooths your skin where cellulite or sagging may exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the fat cells have shrunk, you will see a more desirable and contoured shape. The heat used in this skin treatment
                        boosts collagen production, giving the skin more strength. When your skin has more collagen, it will look smoother
                        and firmer. Sagging and wrinkles will fade.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Science</h2>
                    <p>
                        Treatments using radiofrequency use thermal heat energy to produce stunning results. Thermal heat energy is an oscillating
                        electrical current that produces collisions between ions and molecules, making them into heat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RF thermal stimulation is theorized to cause a micro inflammatory process that encourages the growth of new collagen – a protein
                        that keeps our skin smooth, firm, and supple. This process makes the skin contract, which smooths, tightens, and firms the skin surface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By manipulating skin cooling and delivering radiofrequency energy to precise skin depths, these treatments are highly effective
                        in reducing fat pockets. RF thermal stimulation happens regardless of skin color type, so it is a powerful treatment for patients
                        of every ethnicity. The result? Smooth, tight, more youthful-looking skin. Also, cellulite is less obvious and fat cells shrink
                        to enhance your natural beauty.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Are My Options?</h2>
                    <h2>InMode Contoura</h2>
                    <p>
                        This non-invasive body contouring treatment suctions the skin in the treatment zone and then applies RF energy and heat to the
                        cells. Once undesirable cells are heated to the desired temperature, Contoura delivers several energy pulses to destroy those
                        cells. They stay in the body but are disposed of naturally.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Venus Legacy</h2>
                    <p>
                        This treatment features a handheld device that is moved over the desired area. When the device is moved on the skin, undesirable
                        cells are heated, causing them to shrink. Simultaneously, the heat stimulates collagen production to tighten your skin. This
                        technique shows fast results, but the best results come after six to eight sessions.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Should I Expect?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before we can decide which skin treatment is best for you, we will ask you to visit us for a consultation. Our skin treatment professionals
                        will review the areas you want to treat and discuss your long-term skincare goals. After this information has been collected, a customized
                        treatment plan will be created with the technique that is best for your needs and goals.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Who Is a Good Candidate?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are several prerequisites to determine the ideal candidate for this treatment. The most important factor is to have a healthy and stable
                        weight. RF body contouring is intended to remove stubborn pockets of fat. It will not replace diet and exercise for extensive weight loss.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Patients who have a low, controlled body fat percentage usually see optimal results. These types of bodies see the removal of fat deposits the
                        fastest. If you have a larger area of fat, this is probably best treated with liposuction first.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You also should be willing to undergo several treatments to ensure the optimal amount of fat is removed. Age and health conditions are not as
                        influential on the ideal patient for this skin treatment. This is because it is a non-invasive treatment with few side effects.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Is the Difference Between Radiofrequency Body Contouring and Other Treatments?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The major difference between this treatment and traditional liposuction is that this method dissolves fat cells and firms collagen in the patient’s
                        skin. The result is a naturally contoured shape. This is also a non-invasive treatment with fewer risks and less recovery time than liposuction.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Recommendations for Best Treatment Results</h2>
                    <p>

                    </p>
